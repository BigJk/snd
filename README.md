**Sales & Dungeons** ‚Äî Thermal Printer as D&amp;D Utility.

With Sales & Dungeons you can create highly customizable handouts, quick reference and much more for your Dungeons and Dragons (or other PnP) Sessions.

or a letter that the group found to little character sheets of your players to use as DM note. The possibilities are nearly endless!

## Printer Requirements

At the moment Sales & Dungeons only supports the [ESC/POS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESC/P) (Epson Standard Code) control codes, which is still one of the most used control code set. Check if a thermal printer you are interested in mentions ESC/POS or Epson in the description or manual.

In general the rule of thumb is:
- Most cheap chinese thermal printer found on Amazon or AliExpress support it
- Most epson thermal printer obviously support it
- A lot of older Serial printer (like Metapace T-1) also support it

More specific information about tested printers can be found in the wiki: [Printer-Settings](https://github.com/BigJk/snd/wiki/Printer-Settings)

## How It Works

<img align="left" alt="Sales &amp; Dungeons" src="./data/work_graph.svg">

**Templates:** Templates are created in HTML (and CSS) in combination with the Nunjucks templating language. You can imagine
the templates as little websites. That makes it possible to use all the nice and convenient layout options that HTML and CSS
has to offer and even include any common framework you might need (e.g. Fontawesome for Icons).

**Rendered HTML:** After creating a template you can create entries with the data you want and print them.
Nunjucks will create the rendered HTML from the data you want to print.

**Rendered Image:** Then this HTML get's converted to a image. Currently this conversion is done by Chrome via the
Chrome Debug Protocol. Although Chrome seems like a huge overkill for just HTML-To-Image conversion it's the standard solution at the
moment because it supports most of the modern HTML and CSS features.

**ESC / POS Commands:** The last step before our awesome template hits the Printer is the conversion from the rendered image
to the "draw image" command of the printer.

**Printer:** The generated command will then be sent to the printer and printed. Now your template is ready to be used!
