## üìÅ Download

You can find the latest version on the release page:
- https://github.com/BigJk/snd/releases

### :apple: Mac

The mac bundles are not signed at the moment so you might face the following problems when opening the application:

#### It's not opening because it's from a unverified developer

If your mac is telling you that this app is from a unverified developer you can allow it via the "Privacy & Security" settings. More info: [Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/lv-lv/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac)

#### It's not opening because the app "is damaged"

On M1, M2, etc. it can happen that the app is reported as damaged. Just copy Sales & Dungeons into your Applications folder and execute the following command to allow it to run:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Sales & Dungeons.app/"
```
   
### :whale: Docker

The headless version of Sales & Dungeons (using LibUSB) is also available via a docker container:
1. ``docker pull ghcr.io/bigjk/snd:master`` ([container](https://github.com/BigJk/snd/pkgs/container/snd))
2. ``docker run --expose 7123:7123 --device=/dev/bus/usb -v /some/place/to/persist:/app/userdata ghcr.io/bigjk/snd:master`` (change ``/some/place/to/persist`` to a folder where the user data should be persisted to)
3. Open ``http://127.0.0.1:7123`` in your favorite browser

<details><summary>Docker Compose Example</summary>

```
version: "3"
services:
  snd:
    image: ghcr.io/bigjk/snd:master
    ports:
      - "7123:7123"
    devices:
      - "/dev/bus/usb"
    volumes:
      - "/some/place/to/persist:/app/userdata"
```

</details>

## Printer Requirements

At the moment Sales & Dungeons only supports the [ESC/POS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESC/P) (Epson Standard Code) control codes, which is still one of the most used control code set. Check if a thermal printer you are interested in mentions ESC/POS or Epson in the description or manual.

In general the rule of thumb is:
- Most cheap chinese thermal printer found on Amazon or AliExpress support it
- Most epson thermal printer obviously support it
- A lot of older Serial printer (like Metapace T-1) also support it

More specific information about tested printers can be found in the wiki: [Printer-Settings](https://sales-and-dungeons.app/docs/printer/models/)

## How It Works

<img align="left" alt="Sales &amp; Dungeons" src="./data/work_graph.svg">

**Templates:** Templates are created in HTML (and CSS) in combination with the Nunjucks templating language. You can imagine
the templates as little websites. That makes it possible to use all the nice and convenient layout options that HTML and CSS
has to offer and even include any common framework you might need (e.g. Fontawesome for Icons).

**Rendered HTML:** After creating a template you can create entries with the data you want and print them.
Nunjucks will create the rendered HTML from the data you want to print.

**Rendered Image:** Then this HTML get's converted to a image. Currently this conversion is done by Chrome via the
Chrome Debug Protocol. Although Chrome seems like a huge overkill for just HTML-To-Image conversion it's the standard solution at the
moment because it supports most of the modern HTML and CSS features.

**ESC / POS Commands:** The last step before our awesome template hits the Printer is the conversion from the rendered image
to the "draw image" command of the printer.

**Printer:** The generated command will then be sent to the printer and printed. Now your template is ready to be used!
